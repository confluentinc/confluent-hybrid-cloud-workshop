== Lab {counter:labs}: Connecting to your Workshop Environment

Your environment represents an on-premise data center and consists of a virtual machine hosted in the cloud running several docker containers. In a real world implementation, some of the components would be deployed differently but the logical data flow that we will be working on would remain the same.
You will use a setup that includes a virtual machine in AWS (EC2) configured as a Docker host that will include all the required software to perform the exercises.

To log in to your virtual data center open a terminal session and use the credentials that were assigned to you.

*NOTE: if you are using docker-compose in your computer you don't need to connect with the following ssh command, you will only need to run the commands that are part of the labs locally.*

ssh {dc}@{externalip}

Once logged in run the following command to confirm that you have several docker containers running
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.RunningFor}}\t{{.Status}}"
