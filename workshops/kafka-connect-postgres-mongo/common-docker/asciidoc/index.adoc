|link:kafka-connect-workshop.html[Kafka Connect Workshop]
|Kafka Connect is a free, open-source component of Apache Kafka® that serves as a centralized data hub for simple data integration between databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems. You can use Kafka Connect to stream data between Apache Kafka® and other data systems and quickly create connectors that move large data sets in and out of Kafka.

In this workshop you can learn about how Kafka Connect works, how connectors work for streaming data integration between systems and how to use converters and transformations going through some hands-on exercises.
