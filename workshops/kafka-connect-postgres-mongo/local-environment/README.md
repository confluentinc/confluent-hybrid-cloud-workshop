# Confluent Workshop - Kafka Connect - From Postgres To MongoDB

## Overview

This repository allows you to configure and provision a Docker-based workshop in your local machine. The workshop is intended to act as a psuedo on-premise datacenter. 
The environment has a Postgres database, Confluent Platform and a MongoDB database. It also has browser UI for each component for the ease of connecting to them.

Each workshop participant will work through a series of Labs to perform Database Modernization, using Connectors for data flow between Apache KafkaÂ® and Databases, and using KsqlDb for data processing.

For a single workshop participant, the logical architecture looks like this.

## Prerequisites

* Docker installed.
* Python + [Yaml](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)

## Provisioning a Workshop

There is a file called .env which you need to check before starting in case you want to modify some values:

```
DC=<User name for the workshop>
PASS=<User password for the workshop>
CONFLUENT_DOCKER_TAG=<Docker Confluent images for the workshop>
```
After filling the previous env variables, execute the following command in the local-environment folder:

```
. ./.env
```
Execute the docker-compose.yml file that is on the local-environment folder.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Maybe it takes some minutes to download the images. 

Once all the images have been downloaded you can check if everything is uo and running executing:
```
docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.RunningFor}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

You shpuld see an output like this:

```

```

The workshop is already provisioned and now you can open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/.

You should be able to see the workshop documentation to be able to complete the labs.

When you are finished with the workshop you can destroy it using the following command:

```
docker-compose down
```
