== Lab 2: Getting Started

The primary data source for this workshop is a MySQL database running in your data center. Connected to this database is a orders application which we will discuss shortly.

image::./images/1_mysql.png[]

=== Database Schema

The MySQL database contains a simple schema that includes _Customer_, _Supplier_, _Product_, _Sales Order_ and _Purchase Order_ information. 

The idea behind this schema is simple, customers order products from a company and sales orders get created, the company then sends purchase orders to their suppliers so that product demand can be met by maintaining sensible stock levels.

image::./images/mysql_schema.png[MySQL schema]

We can inspect this schema further by logging into the MySQL CLI...

[source]
----
docker exec -it mysql bash -c 'mysql -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --database orders'
----

...and viewing your tables

[source]
----
show tables;
----

There's an extra table here called `{dc}_out_of_stock_events` that not in the schema diagram above, we'll cover this table separately later on.

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
+--------------------------+
| Tables_in_orders         |
+--------------------------+
| customers                |
| {dc}_out_of_stock_events |
| products                 |
| purchase_order_details   |
| purchase_orders          |
| sales_order_details      |
| sales_orders             |
| suppliers                |
+--------------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
----

Let's view the row count for each table

[source]
----
SELECT * from (
  SELECT 'customers' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM customers 
  UNION 
  SELECT 'products' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM products 
  UNION 
  SELECT 'suppliers' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM suppliers 
  UNION 
  SELECT 'sales_orders' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM sales_orders 
  UNION 
  SELECT 'sales_order_details' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM sales_order_details 
  UNION 
  SELECT 'purchase_orders' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM purchase_orders 
  UNION 
  SELECT 'purchase_order_details' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM purchase_order_details 
) row_counts;
----

As you can see, we have 30 customers, suppliers and products, 0 sales orders and 1 purchase order. 

[source]
----
+------------------------+----------+
| table_name             | COUNT(*) |
+------------------------+----------+
| customers              |       30 |
| products               |       30 |
| suppliers              |       30 |
| sales_orders           |        0 |
| sales_order_details    |        0 |
| purchase_orders        |        1 |
| purchase_order_details |       30 |
+------------------------+----------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
----

The single purchase order was created so we have something in stock to sell, let's have a look at what was ordered.

[source]
----
SELECT * FROM purchase_order_details;
----

[source]
----
+----+-------------------+------------+----------+------+
| id | purchase_order_id | product_id | quantity | cost |

+----+-------------------+------------+----------+------+
30 rows in set (0.00 sec)
----

Here we have a single purchase order that is procuring 100 of each product, this reflects our initial and current stock levels.

Type `exit` to leave the MySQL CLI

=== Starting the Orders Application

To start generating some sales orders we need to start the orders application. This application will continuously create new sales orders to simulate product demand. The application will also raise purchase orders when told to do so, we'll cover this aspect later on in the workshop.

Start the orders application by running the following command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[source]
----
docker exec -dit db-trans-simulator sh -c "python -u /simulate_dbtrans.py > /proc/1/fd/1 2>&1"
----
====

Confirm that the simulator is working as expected

[source]
----
docker logs -f db-trans-simulator
----

You should see an output like this:
[source]
----
Sales Order 1 Created
Sales Order 2 Created
Sales Order 3 Created
Sales Order 4 Created
Sales Order 5 Created
Sales Order 6 Created
...
----

Press `ctrl-c` to quit

We now have `sales_order` and `sales_order_details` rows being created for us by the orders application.

== Lab 3: Stream Events to Confluent Platform

Now that we have data being automatically created in our MySQL database it's time to stream those changes into your on-premise Kafka cluster. We can do this using the link:https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.0/connectors/mysql.html[Debezium MySQL Source connector , window=_blank]

image::./images/2_mysql_source_connector.png[]

=== Create the MySQL source connector

We have a Kafka Connect worker already up and running in a docker container called `kafka-connect-onprem`. This Kafka Connect worker is configured to connect to your on-premise Kafka cluster and has a internal REST server listening on port `18083`. We can create a connector from the command line using the cURL command. The cURL command allows us to send an HTTP POST request to the REST server, the '-H' option specifies the header of the request and includes the target host and port information, the `-d` option specifies the data we will send, in this case its the configuration options for the connector. You can of course create and manage connectors using any tool or language capable of issuing HTTP requests.

To create the Debezium MySQL Source connector instance run the following command:-

[IMPORTANT]
====
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" \
  -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:18083/connectors/ \
  -d '{
    "name": "mysql-source-connector",
    "config": {
          "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
          "database.hostname": "mysql",
          "database.port": "3306",
          "database.user": "mysqluser",
          "database.password": "mysqlpw",
          "database.server.id": "12345",
          "database.server.name": "{dc}",
          "database.whitelist": "orders",
          "table.blacklist": "orders.{dc}_out_of_stock_events",
          "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "broker:29092",
          "database.history.kafka.topic": "debezium_dbhistory" ,
          "include.schema.changes": "false",
          "snapshot.mode": "when_needed",
          "transforms": "unwrap,sourcedc,TopicRename,extractKey",
          "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.UnwrapFromEnvelope",
          "transforms.sourcedc.type":"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField$Value",
          "transforms.sourcedc.static.field":"sourcedc",
          "transforms.sourcedc.static.value":"{dc}",
          "transforms.TopicRename.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.RegexRouter",
          "transforms.TopicRename.regex": "(.*)\\.(.*)\\.(.*)",
          "transforms.TopicRename.replacement": "$1_$3",
          "transforms.extractKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Key",
          "transforms.extractKey.field": "id",
          "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.IntegerConverter"
      }
  }'
----
====

We can confirm the connector is running by querying the REST interface

[source]
----
curl -s localhost:18083/connectors/mysql-source-connector/status | jq
----

You should see that the connector's state is `RUNNING`

[source]
----
{
  "name": "mysql-source-connector",
  "connector": {
    "state": "RUNNING",
    "worker_id": "kafka-connect-onprem:18083"
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "state": "RUNNING",
      "worker_id": "kafka-connect-onprem:18083"
    }
  ],
  "type": "source"
}
----


=== View Messages in Confluent Control Center

Now that the MySQL source connector is up and running, we will be able to see messages appear in our local Kafka cluster. 

We can use link:http://{externalip}:9021[Confluent Control Center, window=_blank] to confirm this. 

Use the following and username and password to authenticate to Confluent Control Center

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
Username: {dc}
Password: your workshop password
----

image::./images/c3_05.png[]

On the landing page we can see that Confluent Control Center is monitoring two Kafka Clusters, our on-premise cluster and a Confluent Cloud Cluster

image::./images/c3_10.png[]

Click on the "controlcenter.cluster" tile, this is your on-premise cluster.

image::./images/c3_20.png[]

Select the Topics Menu on the left

image::./images/c3_30.png[]

Select the `{dc}_sales_order_details` topic

image::./images/c3_40.png[]

Finally select the Messages tab and observe that messages are being streamed into Kafka from MySQL in real time.

== Lab 4: Stream Events to Confluent Cloud

Now that your on-premise Kafka cluster is receiving events from your MySQL Database let's use Confluent Replicator to stream those messages to Confluent Cloud

image::./images/3_replicate_to_ccloud.png[]

=== Create the Replicator Connector Instance

Confluent Replicator uses Kafka Connect under the covers and can be considered a special type of connector, however, unlike other connectors, the source _and_ target technology for the connector is a Kafka Cluster.

To support this connector, we have another Kafka Connect worker running in a different docker container called `kafka-connect-ccloud`. This Kafka Connect worker is configured to connect to the Confluent Cloud instance provisioned for this workshop. This Kafka Connect worker has an internal REST server listening on port `18084`.

Run the following from the command line to create the Replicator Connector instance, this connector will replicate events from you on-premise Kafka cluster to your Confluent Cloud Cluster.

  ],
  "type": "source"
}
----

=== Confirm that Messages are Arriving in Confluent Cloud

Jump back to link:http://{externalip}:9021[Confluent Control Center, window=_blank]

You can always reach back the home by clicking on the confluent logo on the top left, or by clicking ont the HOME in the top navigation bar.
Select the "ccloud" cluster and then select "Topics". 

This Confluent Cloud Instance is being shared by other users of the workshop and as a result you will see topics being replicated from other data centers. To see just your topics, type your data center name, {dc}, into the search box at the top to filter.

image::./images/c3_60.png[]

Select the `{dc}_sales_order_details` topic and finally the "Messages" tab under the topic heading. You should see messages streaming in from your on-premise Kafka cluster.

image::./images/c3_70.png[]

We can also view the status of Replicator in Confluent Control Center by selecting "Replicators" on the left-hand navigation pane. Here we can see throughput and latency statistics.

== Lab 5: Creating a ksqlDB Application

We now have all the data we need being streamed, in realtime, to Confluent Cloud. You have a ksqlDB Server running inside a docker container that is configured to point to our Confluent Cloud cluster. In a real world deployment, it is likely that this ksqlDB Server would be running closer to Confluent Cloud but for the purposes of this workshop it is not important.

image::./images/4_ksql_application.png[]

Below is an illustration of the completed Supply & Demand ksqlDB Application, over the next few labs you will be building this step-by-step.

=== Start the ksqlDB CLI

To start the ksqlDB CLI run the following command:-

[IMPORTANT]
====
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server-ccloud:8088
----

ksql>

```

The ksqlDB CLI is pointing at a ksqlDB Server connected to your Confluent Cloud instance.

To view a list of all topics in Confluent Cloud run the following command:-

`show topics;`

You should see your own topics, `{dc}_*`, along with topics from other workshop users.

```
ksql> show topics;

 Kafka Topic                 | Partitions | Partition Replicas
---------------------------------------------------------------
 dc01_customers              | 1          | 3
 dc01_products               | 1          | 3
 dc01_purchase_order_details | 1          | 3
 dc01_purchase_orders        | 1          | 3
 dc01_sales_order_details    | 1          | 3
 dc01_sales_orders           | 1          | 3
 dc01_suppliers              | 1          | 3
 dc02_customers              | 1          | 3

 dc02_sales_order_details    | 1          | 3
...
```

=== Inspect a topic\'s contents

To inspect the contents of a topic run the following:-

`PRINT {dc}_sales_orders;`

You should see something similar:-

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
ksql> PRINT {dc}_sales_orders;
Key format: AVRO
Value format: AVRO
rowtime: 2020/05/20 10:10:29.264 Z, key: {"id": 1}, value: {"id": 1, "order_date": 1589969387000, "customer_id": 14, "sourcedc": "{dc}"}
rowtime: 2020/05/20 10:10:29.265 Z, key: {"id": 2}, value: {"id": 2, "order_date": 1589969392000, "customer_id": 14, "sourcedc": "{dc}"}
rowtime: 2020/05/20 10:10:29.265 Z, key: {"id": 3}, value: {"id": 3, "order_date": 1589969397000, "customer_id": 14, "sourcedc": "{dc}"}
rowtime: 2020/05/20 10:10:29.265 Z, key: {"id": 4}, value: {"id": 4, "order_date": 1589969402000, "customer_id": 7, "sourcedc": "{dc}"}
...
----

Press `ctrl-c` to stop

=== ksqlDB Streams

In order to work with a stream of data in ksqlDB we first need to register a stream over an existing topic.

We can do this using a `CREATE STREAM` statement. Run the following command to create your first ksqlDB stream:-

[IMPORTANT]
====
[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
*CREATE STREAM* sales_orders *WITH* (KAFKA_TOPIC='{dc}_sales_orders', PARTITIONS=1, VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');
----
====

image::./images/ksql_001.png[align="center"]

You should see the following output

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM sales_orders WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='{dc}_sales_orders', PARTITIONS=1, VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');

 Message
----------------
 Stream created
----------------
----

Create streams for each of your remaining topics

To view your current streams run the following command:-

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
SHOW STREAMS;
----

Notice that each stream is mapped to an underlying Kafka topic and that the format is AVRO. 

[source,subs="attributes"]
----
 Stream Name            | Kafka Topic                 | Format
---------------------------------------------------------------
 CUSTOMERS              | {dc}_customers              | AVRO
 PRODUCTS               | {dc}_products               | AVRO
 PURCHASE_ORDERS        | {dc}_purchase_orders        | AVRO
 PURCHASE_ORDER_DETAILS | {dc}_purchase_order_details | AVRO
 SALES_ORDERS           | {dc}_sales_orders           | AVRO
 SALES_ORDER_DETAILS    | {dc}_sales_order_details    | AVRO
 SUPPLIERS              | {dc}_suppliers              | AVRO
---------------------------------------------------------------
----

To view the details of an individual topic you can you can use the `describe` command:-

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
*DESCRIBE* sales_order_details;
----

Notice that all the columns have been created for us and we didn't need to explicitly set their names and data types when we created the stream, this is one of the advantages of using AVRO and the Schema Registry.

Also notice that ksqlDB adds an implicit `ROWKEY` column to every stream and table, which represents the corresponding Kafka message key.

== Lab 6: Querying Streams with ksqlDB

There are two types of query in ksqlDB, *Push* queries and *Pull* queries.

* https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/select-push-query/[Push Queries] enable you to subscribe to a result as it changes in real-time. You can subscribe to the output of any query, including those that return a stream or a materialized aggregate table. The `EMIT CHANGES` clause is used to indicate a query is a push query.
* https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/select-pull-query/[Pull Queries] enable you to look up information at a point in time.

Another important point to understand is where within a stream a query starts to read from. You can control this behaviour using the `ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset` property. This property can either be set to `earliest` where data is consumed from the very beginning of the topic or `latest` where only new data is consumed.

To see the current values for _all_ properties run the following command 
 
[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
SHOW PROPERTIES;
----

Look out for a property called `ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset`, it should currently be set to `earliest`.

[source,subs="attributes"]

ksql>
----

You can override this setting to suit you needs:-

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
*SET* 'ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
*SET* 'ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset'='latest';
----

Or preferably, using the abbreviated property names:-

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
*SET* 'auto.offset.reset' = 'latest';
*SET* 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
----

Let's start by running a Push query and consume all messages from the beginning of a stream.

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
*SET* 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
*SELECT*  id, 
        sales_order_id, 
        product_id, 
        quantity, 
        price 
*FROM*  sales_order_details 
*EMIT CHANGES*;
----

You should see something similar to this:-

Notice that events continue to stream to the console until you explicitly cancel the query, this is because when we are working with streams in ksqlDB the data set is unbounded and could theoretically continue forever.

To inspect a bounded set of data, you can use the `LIMIT` clause.

        sales_order_id, 
        product_id,

*EMIT CHANGES*
*LIMIT* 10;

=== Filtering Streams

Since ksqlDB is based on SQL, you can do many of the standard SQL things you'd expect to be able to do, including predicates and projections. The following query will return a stream of  you the latest sales orders where the `quantity` column is greater than 3.

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
*SET* 'auto.offset.reset'='latest';
*SELECT*  id, 
        product_id, 
        quantity
*FROM*    sales_order_details
*WHERE*   quantity > 3 
*EMIT CHANGES*;
----

You should only see events where the `quantity` column value is greater than `3`.

== Lab 7: Creating ksqlDB tables

ksqlDB tables allow you to work the data in topics as key/value pairs, with a single value for each key. Tables can be created from an existing topic or from the query results from other tables or streams. You can read more about this https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/concepts.html#duality-of-streams-and-tables[here].

=== Creating Tables

We want to create tables over our `customers`, `suppliers` and `products` streams so we can look up the current state for each customer, supplier and product. Later on we'll be joining these tables to other streams. To successfully join to a table in ksqlDB you need to ensure that the table is keyed on the column you are going to use in the join. Our underlying topics already have the correct key set thanks to the Debezium MySQL connector configuration so we just need to use the `PRIMARY KEY` clause when we create each table.

Create your 3 ksqlDB tables.

We'll use these tables soon and join them to our streams.

== Lab 8: Joining Streams & Tables with ksqlDB

We can join two streams together in ksqlDB using a windowed join. When using a windowed join, you must specify a windowing scheme by using the `WITHIN` clause. A new input record on one side produces a join output for each matching record on the other side, and there can be multiple such matching records within a join window.

In the example below you can see that we are joining the `sales_orders` stream to the `sales_order_details` stream using a window of 1 seconds (`INNER JOIN sales_order_details od WITHIN 1 SECONDS ON (o.id = od.sales_order_id)`). The orders application creates sales orders and their associated sales order detail rows at the same time, so 1 second will be plenty of time to ensure that a join takes place.

We are also joining to the `customers_tbl` and `products_tbl` tables

If we run a describe on this stream...

----
*DESCRIBE* sales_enriched;

...you'll see that we have effectively denormalized the `sales_orders`, `sales_order_details`, `customers` and `products` streams/tables into a single event stream.

We now need to create an equivalent `purchases_enriched` stream that combines the `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_details`, `suppliers` and `products` streams/tables. Since the purchases data model is very similar to that of the sales data model the query looks very similar.

...you'll see that we have also denormalized the `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_details`, `suppliers` and `products` streams/tables into a single event stream.

Let's query the `purchases_enriched` stream from the very beginning

Notice that the query returns the first 30 purchase order lines and then stops; this is because no purchase orders are being created by our orders application. The orders application will raise purchase orders for us when we send it some out of stock events.

== Lab 9: Streaming Current Stock Levels

Before we can create an out of stock event stream, we need to work out the current stock levels for each product. We can do this by combining the `sales_enriched` stream with the `purchases_enriched` stream and summing the `sales_enriched.quantity` column (stock decrements) and the `purchases_enriched.quantity` column (stock increments).

Let's have a go at this now by creating a new stream called `product_supply_and_demand`. This stream is consuming messages from the `sales_enriched` stream and included the `product_id` and `quantity` column converted to a negative value, we do this because sales events are our _demand_ and hence decrement stock.

We're now is a position where we can calculate the current stock level for each product. We can do this by creating a table that groups by the `product_id` and sums up the `quantity` column which contains both stock decrements and stock increments.

When we query this table with a Push query...

*SET* 'auto.offset.reset'='latest';
*SELECT*  product_id,
        stock_level
*FROM*  current_stock
*EMIT CHANGES*;
----

...each new event that is displayed on the console reflects the current stock level for the associated product, a new event will be emitted  each time a product's stock level changes. 
Depending on how long it took you to get to this point in the workshop, you may see that all your stock levels are negative. This is because, apart from the initial purchase order for 100 of each product, we have not created any more purchase orders and our customers will have their orders on hold until we acquire more stock, not good, but we'll fix that soon.

== Lab 10: Pull Queries

We can now run our first Pull query. Pull queries are used against tables with aggregates and can only query a single key.

To run a Pull query we just query the table as normal but drop the `EMIT CHANGES` clause. In this query we are asking "*what is the _current_ stock level for product id 1?*"

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
select product_id, stock_level from current_stock where rowkey=15;
----

image::./images/ksql_015.png[align="center"]

The query will return the current stock level and immediatly terminate.

We can also use the ksqlDB Server's REST endpoint to make Pull queries.

Exit from the ksqlDB CLI and run the following from the command line.

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
curl -s -X "POST" "http://localhost:8088/query" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json; charset=utf-8" -d $'{ "ksql": "select product_id, stock_level from current_stock where rowkey=15;" }'| jq .
----

As you can see, the ksqlDB Server's REST endpoint will return a JSON message with the `product_id` and its current `stock_level`. This is useful for applications that want access to the current state of the world using a request/response type pattern.

== Lab 11: Streaming Recent Product Demand

Now that we know the current stock level is for each product, we can use this information to send an event to the orders application and ask it to create purchase orders to replenish the stock, but how much should we stock should we order? we could just order enough to satisfy the current backlog but we'd quickly run out of stock again. 

What we really want to do is order enough to satisfy the backlog _and_ enough to meet future demand, we can make an attempt at predicting what the future demand will be by looking at the past.

In the following query we are creating a table that will calculate the demand for each product over the last 3 minutes using a `WINDOW HOPPING` clause.

Hopping windows are based on time intervals. They model fixed-sized, possibly overlapping windows. A hopping window is defined by two properties: the window’s duration and its advance, or “hop”, interval. The advance interval specifies how far a window moves forward in time relative to the previous window. In our query we we have a window with a duration of three minutes and an advance interval of one minute. Because hopping windows can overlap, a record can belong to more than one such window.

== Lab 12: Streaming _"Out of Stock"_ Events

Now that we have the `current_stock` table and `product_demand_last_3mins` stream, we can create a `out_of_stock_events` stream by joining the two together and calculating the required purchase order quantity. We calculate the `purchase_qty` from adding the inverse of the current stock level to the last 3 minutes of demand. The stream is filtered to only include products that have negative stock and therefore need purchase orders raising for them.

== Lab 13: Replicate Events to On-Premise Kafka

The next step is to replicate the `out_of_stock_events` topic to our on-premise cluster.

image::./images/5_replicate_to_onprem.png[]	

Before we do that, let's create the target topic in our on-premise Kafka cluster using link:http://{externalip}:9021[Confluent Control Center, window=_blank]	
Select your on-premise cluster from the home, select _"topics"_ and then click on _"Add a Topic"_. 	

[IMPORTANT]
====
image::./images/c3_80.png[]	

Name the topic `{dc}_out_of_stock_events` with one partition and click _"Create with defaults"_	

image::./images/c3_90.png[]	

We are now ready to replicate this topic from Confluent Cloud to your on-premise cluster.

Notice that we've specified only to replicate the `{dc}_out_of_stock_events` topic by configuring `"topic.whitelist": "{dc}_out_of_stock_events"`

We can confirm that the `{dc}_out_of_stock_events` is being replicated from Confluent Cloud to our on-premise cluster by checking for messages in link:http://{externalip}:9021[Confluent Control Center, window=_blank]

== Lab 14: Sink Events into MySQL

Finally we need to sink the `{dc}_out_of_stock_events` topic into a MySQL database table, the on-premise application will then process these events and create purchase order for us.

image::./images/6_jdbc_sink.png[]

But before we do that, let's open a couple more terminal sessions and start the ksqlDB CLI in each.

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
ssh {dc}@{externalip}
----

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server-ccloud:8088
----

Execute the following query in the 1st session...

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
SET 'auto.offset.reset'='latest';
SELECT  product_id,
        stock_level
FROM  current_stock
EMIT CHANGES;
----

...and this query in the 2nd session

[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
SET 'auto.offset.reset'='latest';
SELECT  product_id,
        product_qty
FROM  purchases_enriched
EMIT CHANGES;
----

You now have a real time view of the current product stock levels in the first ksqlDB session and the purchases being made to replenish the stock in second. Not that the second query isn't returning anything yet.

Let's now sink the _out of stock events_ to the MySQL database using the JDBC Connector. Once the events start arriving in the database, the orders application will process them and start generating the required purchase orders.

In a third terminal session, create the JDBC Sink Connector by running the following from the command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[source,subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" \
    -H  "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:18083/connectors/ \
    -d '{
        "name": "jdbc-mysql-sink",
        "config": {
          "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector",
          "topics": "{dc}_out_of_stock_events",
          "connection.url": "jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/orders",
          "connection.user": "mysqluser",
          "connection.password": "mysqlpw",
          "insert.mode": "INSERT",
          "batch.size": "3000",
          "auto.create": "true",
          "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter"
       }
    }'
----
====

Observe the current stock query in the first ksqlDB session, when a product has zero or less stock you should see a purchase event appear in the second ksqlDB session and then the new stock level reflected in the first session. In theory, given a constant demand, each product should run out of stock and get replenished roughly every 3 minutes.
