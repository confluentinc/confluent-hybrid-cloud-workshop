== Lab {counter:labs}: Connecting to your Workshop Environment

Your environment represents an on-premise data center and consists of a virtual machine hosted in the cloud running several docker containers. In a real world implementation, some of the components would be deployed differently but the logical data flow that we will be working on would remain the same.

To login to your virtual data center open a terminal session and use the credentials that were assigned to you

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
ssh {dc}@{externalip} 
----

Once logged in run the following command to confirm that you have several docker containers running
[source,subs=attributes+]
----
docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.RunningFor}}\t{{.Status}}"
